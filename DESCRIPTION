Description: HTTP Headers Hashing (HHHash) is a technique used to create a 
    fingerprint of an HTTP server based on the headers it returns. HHHash 
		employs one-way hashing to generate a hash value for the set of header
		keys returned by the server. See
		<https://www.foo.be/2023/07/HTTP-Headers-Hashing_HHHash> for more info.
